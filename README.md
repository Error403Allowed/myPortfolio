## How can I edit this code?

There are several ways of editing your application.

**Use Lovable**

Simply visit the [Lovable Project](https://lovable.dev/projects/REPLACE_WITH_PROJECT_ID) and start prompting.

Changes made via Lovable will be committed automatically to this repo.

**Use your preferred IDE**

If you want to work locally using your own IDE, you can clone this repo and push changes. Pushed changes will also be reflected in Lovable.

The only requirement is having Node.js & npm installed - [install with nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)

Follow these steps:

```sh
# Step 1: Clone the repository using the project's Git URL.
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Step 3: Install the necessary dependencies.
npm i

# Step 4: Start the development server with auto-reloading and an instant preview.
npm run dev
```

## AI Chatbot setup

The site includes a bottom-right chatbot widget and a secure Hugging Face proxy script with API key rotation.

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your API keys.
2. Start the proxy in one terminal:

```sh
npm run chat:proxy
```

3. Start the Vite app in another terminal:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Notes:
- Keep API keys only in server env vars (`API_KEY_1`, `API_KEY_2`).
- The proxy rotates keys per request and automatically fails over to the next key on rate-limit/transient errors.
- If frontend and proxy are on different origins, keep `VITE_CHAT_API_URL` and `CHAT_ALLOWED_ORIGIN` aligned.

**Edit a file directly in GitHub**

- Navigate to the desired file(s).
- Click the "Edit" button (pencil icon) at the top right of the file view.
- Make your changes and commit the changes.

**Use GitHub Codespaces**

- Navigate to the main page of your repository.
- Click on the "Code" button (green button) near the top right.
- Select the "Codespaces" tab.
- Click on "New codespace" to launch a new Codespace environment.
- Edit files directly within the Codespace and commit and push your changes once you're done.
